# Changelog

All notable changes to the FlightPlan client are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [unreleased]

### Changed
- Snippet warn rule softened: when an overlap is the very work the agent was
  asked to act on, or the task is read-only, the agent mentions it and keeps
  going instead of pausing for confirmation.

## [0.1] — 2026-07-30

### Added
- Initial public release (package 0.9.0). `getflightplan install|mcp`: the MCP
  stdio client and a one-command install kit — writes the agent snippet into
  `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` between managed markers, pins the repo name in
  `.flightplan.toml`, installs the `/registry-digest` command and the
  session-end stop hook, then verifies and offers to fix MCP registration for
  Claude Code and Codex (one key prompt, saved-key reuse, re-verify).
  Pre-PyPI install: `uvx --from git+https://github.com/sledmonkey/getflightplan
  getflightplan install`. Apache-2.0.
